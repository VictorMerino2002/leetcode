# 49 - Group Anagrams

## Description

Given an array of strings strs, group the together. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Explanation:

    There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
    The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
    The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]

Output: [[""]]

Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]

Output: [["a"]]

 

Constraints:

    1 <= strs.length <= 104
    0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
    strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

To solve this, problem I iterated over the array of Strings and create a sorted array of chars of the word to use it as the key of a HashMap with an array as value containing the words with the same key. Once the loop is finished, I return the values of the HashMap into an array.
